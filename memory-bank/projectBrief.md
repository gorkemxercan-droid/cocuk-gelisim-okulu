# Project Brief

## Overview
A web-based platform for a **Kindergarten / Baby School** aimed at children aged 0-6. The site serves as a digital face for the institution, providing information about the curriculum, staff, events, and contact details for parents.

## Core Goals
1.  **Promote the Brand**: Showcase the school's vision, mission, and values.
2.  **Inform Parents**: Provide details on educational programs, weekly workshops, and the teaching staff.
3.  **Lead Generation**: Encourage parents to contact the school or register via the contact form.

## Current Status
-   The project consists of static HTML files with embedded CSS/JS.
-   **CRITICAL ISSUE**: There is a significant design and branding inconsistency between the Homepage (`index.html`) and the inner pages (`etkinlikler.html`, `ekibimiz.html`, etc.).
    -   **Homepage**: "İlk Yaşlar Baby School" (Blue theme, Quicksand font).
    -   **Inner Pages**: "Renkli Anaokulu" / "Renkli Dünyalar" (Yellow theme, Plus Jakarta Sans font).
-   **Immediate Goal**: Resolve this inconsistency and unify the design language.
